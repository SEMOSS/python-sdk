# Test Playground

Use this directory to store any test scripts you create that help you test/debug/develop. This directory is ignored by git so any files in this directory will not be committed to the repository.

The purpose of this directory is so that you can run scripts against the local code instead of running notebooks outside of the project that pull the code in from the package. This is useful for debugging and testing.
